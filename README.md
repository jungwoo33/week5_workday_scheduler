## 1. Title: Workday Scheduler
## 2. App Description
This code will generate a simple "Daily Work Scheduler". A user can save a dayily schedule (from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). The color in each timeblock indicates whether it is in the past (![#d3d3d3](https://placehold.co/15x15/d3d3d3/d3d3d3.png)), present (![#ff6961](https://placehold.co/15x15/ff6961/ff6961.png)), or future (![#77dd77](https://placehold.co/15x15/77dd77/77dd77.png)). Once a user saves his/her schedule, the schedule will be stored in a local storage and automatically retrieved when the app is reopenned. Then, enjoy your daily work - to me, following-up the bootcamp class is my primary daily work since it is my first experience in HTML/CSS/JavaScript/GitHub...!

## 3. Source Code Description
This code includes following codes:
* _index.html: main HTML file_ 
* _style.css: CSS style sheet_
* _script.js: JavaScript file_ 

Note: All previous versions are stored: ./old_codes; I am keeping old files to show the progress.
