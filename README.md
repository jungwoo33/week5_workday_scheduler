## 1. Title: Workday Scheduler
## 2. App Description
This code will generate a simple "Daily Work Scheduler". A user can save a dayily schedule (from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.) and save the schedule. The saved schedule will be stored in a local storage and automatically retrieved when the app is reopenned. Then, enjoy your daily work - to me, following-up the bootcamp class since it is my first experience in HTML/CSS/JavaScript/GitHub...!

## 3. Source Code Description
This code includes following codes:
* _index.html: main HTML file_ 
* _style.css: CSS style sheet_
* _script.js: JavaScript file_ 

Note: All previous versions are stored: ./old_codes; I am keeping old files to show the progress.
